I can see line numbers at left; and if I open; e.g. the updater window; I can see the contents without any problems. Since this was my first time using eclipse on this system; I tried 4.3 and all views were displaying contents. Then I started 4.3 with SWT_GTK3=1 and all contents were gone. So this is something to do with GTK3 but I have no idea of what else should I use to debug the issue.   \n",

I can see line numbers at left; and if I open; e.g. the updater window; I can see the contents without any problems. Since this was my first time using eclipse on this system; I tried 4.3 and all views were displaying contents. Then I started 4.3 with SWT_GTK3=1 and all contents were gone. So this is something to do with GTK3 but I have no idea of what else should I use to debug the issue.   \n",
